          and our main development and support site at

            https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de .

          The latter site, in particular, has a wiki to collect information, as well
          as an issue tracker to log discussions, suggest improvements, and report issues
          or bugs. https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de is also the main development site
          of the project and all new and updated code versions can be obtained there.
          Please send an email to aims-coordinators@fhi-berlin.mpg.de and we will add
          you to these sites. They are for you and everyone is welcome there.

  No trust radius initializer. Defaulting to   0.200000E+00 A.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.

  | This file contains the geometry of the current relaxation step as well as
  | the current Hessian matrix needed to restart the relaxation algorithm.
  | If you do not want part or all of this information, use the keywords
  | "write_restart_geometry" or "hessian_to_restart_geometry" to switch the output off.
  Defaulting to use time-reversal symmetry for k-point grid.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for all serial calculations. This is mandatory.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.42010817 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99990701
  | K-point:      20 at    0.125000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.36656227 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00024797
  | K-point:      43 at    0.250000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05354589 eV between HOMO at k-point 20 and LUMO at k-point 43
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.39512398 eV for k_point 34 at    0.125000    0.625000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.03970681 eV between HOMO at k-point 12 and LUMO at k-point 2

  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.20406153 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99966220
  | K-point:       5 at    0.000000    0.125000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -7.15550160 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00102721
  | K-point:       2 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04855992 eV between HOMO at k-point 5 and LUMO at k-point 2
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.39321328 eV for k_point 34 at    0.125000    0.625000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -222471.853000009 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -222471.853000448 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -33.689816450 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       48.597 MB (on task 116 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Maximum:       54.674 MB (on task  14 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Average:       52.054 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       17.627 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 116)
          |   Maximum:       21.278 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  14)
          |   Average:       19.698 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
