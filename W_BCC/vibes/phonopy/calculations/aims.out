  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -905396.057159859 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -905396.057159859 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -37.957513951 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       55.820 MB (on task  21 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Maximum:       59.727 MB (on task  94 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Average:       57.678 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       22.545 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  21)
          |   Maximum:       24.939 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  64)
          |   Average:       23.665 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
