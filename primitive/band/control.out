 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.

  | K-point:      31 at    0.750000    0.125000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.89384379 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 31
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.99796938 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.14021818 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:      20 at    0.375000    0.250000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.85775120 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 20
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.99096746 eV for k_point 20 at    0.375000    0.250000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.
